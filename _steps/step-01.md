### Examples of embedding

#### Images

![image](assets/magnifying-glass-logo.jpeg)

- keep the `assets/` and make sure that the image file is located within
  that directory.

If the image is online, you can follow this format:

![image](https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/03/72/65/61/240_F_372656177_0u76f9fpzj1ykEofM30CLrGsfzHWPUkF.jpg)

- replace the link url with the image url you would like to display

#### Videos
