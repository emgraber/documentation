## Detailed TODOs

In GitHub, navigate to the directory named `_steps`. Inside, there is one
file per step. The writing is done in markdown which uses special symbols
to format the text. You must update the heading and write a paragraph in
each file to document and explain your process. Hit save and commit
before navigating to any new pages! These files will be turned into a
website automatically by GitHub.

You can find examples of how to embed videos, images, and audio in
`step-01.md`. This can be copied as needed for the other steps.

The actual images and audio files to embed should come from your project.
The files should be stored within the `assets` directory.

Remember to save and commit before navigating to any new pages!

The last step must include the audio from your final product.

### Turn the Repo into a website

- TODO: In GitHub, go to settings>pages. Under branch, click
